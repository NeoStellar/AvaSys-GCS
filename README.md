 ## About The Project

![Product Screenshot](https://anilsayar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image.png)

AvaSYS, AvaSYS Ground Control Station is a Ground Control Station application for unmanned armed vehicles. It is designed for ease of use and gather information at its highest priority.

The goal of AvaSYS is to look and feel like “QGroundControl”, main difference will be easy of usage. While software like “QGroundControl” is much more feature packed and great for advanced users; for beginners, Teknofest competitors or people who only want data etc. will benefit from these software. AvaSYS aims to be the solution for these kinds of people.

This project is originally intended for the Turkey Teknofest competition in 2024 for the warrior UAV category, but I am committed to developing the application even beyond the competition and into future iterations.
