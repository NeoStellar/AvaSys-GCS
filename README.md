# AvaSys Ground Control System (GCS) - Linux

AvaSys GCS is the ground control system software of the Utku aircraft developed by Neo Stellar for the TEKNOFEST SAVA≈ûAN UAV competition.

Our software allows us to control features such as making quick flight mode changes in our unmanned aerial vehicle, listing and editing the vehicle's parameters, self-testing the aircraft at startup, and listing problems.
